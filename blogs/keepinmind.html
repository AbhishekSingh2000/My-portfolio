    <h2>1. Importance of Mentorship</h2>
    <p>In a career which is extremely vast and filled with numbers of niche industries it's good to explore but it's better to explore with a guidance of a mentor as sometimes things get really overwhelming when you do stuff which actually doesn't make sense at that stage of time but you feel like doing it for your own reasons and when you find the drawbacks of the situation, cahnces are you might start devaluing and the potential of the Industry. This way you can get demoralised and might stop exploring and even if you go forward with it, what are the chances that the same thing won't happen again with you. But what if an already experienced person is their to guide and stop you from doing unnecessary stuff and can discuss the perks and drawbacks of a niche industry and whether is it the right time to do it or even whether doing this will even help you in building your basics right. Going alone on a path is not a bad idea but getting a mentor for your direction is a better one. If you are unable to find a mentor which is nearly impossible but if it's happening then you might be finding one in wrong place, or the wrong way. Mentors are like a live roadmap not only for your programming journey but even outside it as tehy can guide you about the mindset, lifestyle changes and what not to achieve your success.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>2. Importance of your own Choices</h2>
    <p>Importance of choices is same as making decisions. No this is a very critical thing to explain but you need to understand certain things. You should not be going forward with someine else's choices, this might sound a little contradictary with the 1st point but believe the mentor, he won't be person to bring you in the situation probably. What I am talking about is the opinions on the open internet or even your peer group. Listening to everybody is good but do what seems right to you. Apply your brain and understand the context of the statement and if it seems difficult, eliminate the advice. Nobody will bring the bread on your plate, ultimately you have to be responsible for that and work accordingly. Don't let advices be a distraction for you. But keep the thing in the mind that if you are making a decision than you are responsible for it and if you are agreeing to someone's advice and turning that into your decision than also you are the only person responsible. </p>

    <h2>3. Depending on College/ Institution</h2>
    <p>Depending on their college is the worst mistake anyone can do in their entire life as a programmer. Colleges are not meant to teach you alone in a room. They have a responsibility to guide and teach multiple people at a time, complete the syllabus and take their money, ironically they get paid before the service but that's a different issue altogether. Even if you are in a Tier 1 college, it is advisable to focus and learn things on your own and not expect that from your college as colleges are the new real estate companies who are creatively charging you the rent only. Colleges are not responsible for your success or either your failure so take the first step forward and stop getting dependent on others. Most of the students think that they can learn programming from the college but ironically very less number of programmers learns it from their colleges instead they are all self taught. If you have any hope to learn programming from college, I would suggest you to let it bea fancy and pave your own path towards prgramming or you might get overwhelmed and might giveup on programming.</p>

    <h2>4. Going after the Buzzwords</h2>
    <p>We as humans have the tendency to go after the things where others are heading in masses as we think if so many people are doing the same thing then it would probably be the right thing to do and also the easiest path. This is called FOMO - Fear Of Missing Out, in the fear of missing the advantage which others might get, we tend to do sam ething out of our fear and beginnersa in their programming journey also does the same mistake, they start watching the "latest tech videos" and people start advising them to do VR, blockchain, AI and what not and listening to this, beginners follow thes extremely difficult but not so rewarding paths and waste their time doing this and not building their basics right. They need to understand that for the best path in their career thay have to learn how things work and and then building relvant skills so that they can even get paid to do the work, they should talk to people doing the jobs and understand the daily job role  in the industry instead of watching random youtube videos for guidance. </p>
    <br>
    <h2>5. Not being flexible enough</h2>
    <p>Beginners have one common mistake in common, if they start learning a technology, they treat it like they are going to do this for their whole life, but this is a wrong mindset because this way programmers will not learn to their fullest potential and it's not the life of a programmer. They need to be flexible enough to learn new thing in accordance to the need of the hour to build the product.</p>
