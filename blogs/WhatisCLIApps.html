    <p>You would have watched a lot of Movies where hackers and Developers use their superpowers on keyboards and some green numbers and alphabets shuffles extremely fast. But did you ever gave a thought that why your computer doesn't look same? First of all that kind of processing is done by really powerful computers(for that fast shuffling) and secondly whatever is shown in Movies is Animations and they know that these kind off cool stuff excites people. So what is a CLI App? Its like chatting with your system but in the language which is easy to understand for both of you. CLI(Command Line Interface) is that window (screenshot is the image provided above) and whatever you does with a mouse can be done by that window and keyboard also. Infact in the Initial times of computers, this was the only way to interact with a computer and even now many developers use it daily, now how is it helpful to developers? Because this way they can access generally every file on their PC and even access the internet and this saves them from moving and opening multiple windows or folders and finding things the GUI(Graphical User Interface) way  Can you do it? Anyday people, but it requires a little bit of training. Now when your this window works specificalluy for a single purpose or a specific set of features, it is then called a CLI App similar to the apps in your phone. </p>
