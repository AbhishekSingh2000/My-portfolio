    <p>There’s no denying that technology now dominates a huge amount of different industries. Being computer illiterate just won’t cut it any more in the world of work. And ‘learning to code’ seems to be the buzzword at the moment. And everyone from Bill Gates to Obama is encouraging young people to give it a go. But what exactly does learning to code entail? And why is it so important? </p>
    <h2>Coding can lead to software development jobs</h2>
    <p>Coding is the fundamental skill for jobs such as software development. There is currently a shortage of software developers worldwide, so learning to code can be an easy route into an open field of work. However, this isn’t the only way coding can open up job opportunities.</p>
    <h2>Coding literacy can help you understand other aspects of tech</h2>
    <p>Knowledge of coding (or, as some call it, coding literacy) can help in other ways, too. It can mean you are quicker to learn other aspects or tech, plus mean you are more digitally fluent. In today’s ever more digital job market, this can only be of benefit.</p>
    <h2>It could lead to freelance work</h2>
    <p>If you’re wanting to go freelance, or have the ability to work while traveling, coding may be a great way to get into this. As coding is a highly valued skill at the moment, many companies are willing to outsource the work. This means skilled coders have the ability to create their own schedule (and charge a nice rate for it at the same time).</p>
    <h2>Coding can boost problem solving and logic skills</h2>
    <p>utside from the implications of coding which look good on a resume, coding actually does boost skills which are actually useful to most jobs. Problem solving and logic are the main two. Learning to code is like an exercise session for the “left” side of the brain.</p>
