        <h1>Importance of Alt text/ Alternative text </h1>
    <small>4th August, 2021</small>
    <img class="showcase-list container container-center" src="/images/alt text.png" />
    <p>If you regularly use Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and post your pictures on these platforms often then you might have noticed that it asks for alt text which is obviously optional but what does that signify ? What purpose does it fulfill ? Even as web developer whenever we code to put up picture on the web page, the syntax of the code has a section of alt text and if you want to know more about the syntax of the code then google the term "Image tag in HTML - mdn reference". This alt text is a feature built for people who are physically challenged with respect to their eyes. What if blind people want to use twitter, Instagram and Facebook, how will they know what has been posted. The Alt text feature is at rescue to this, now you might ask how does that help to blind person because if he can't see the image he can't even see the text also, but my friend you forgot that a blind can't see thing but can listen to sound, right! 

        But how will he listen to sound phones doesn't speak right? No, phones do speak, in modern day every smartphone has a feature of speaking whatever is present on the screen under accessibility setting under the settings. Even computers can also speak after certain setting changes, So when you put an alt text for an image for example you posted a picture of your pet dog and put the alt text as, "My pet Dog Tommy", this way a blind person can also know that an online friend of his posted his pet dog's picture online and can also take the essence of the event.
        
        The story doesn't end here, alt text is not only used by blinds but also useful to normal people. How? Whenver you open a website and it doesn't loads the image and if the developer has put the alt text in position then without even looking at the image you can tell what can be available on the site in place of picture by looking at the desciption of picture which is placed in the position of alt text. </p>
