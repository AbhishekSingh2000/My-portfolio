    <p>If you ever put a little thought and look at the second part of the word, it's HUB, a Hub filled with millions of lines codes but its not like a dumpyard its completely organised highly managed nad maintained pieces of codes/software, every user maintaines his code in  a file directory structure. If you want to know by much simpler way, then its a cloud system where instead of uploading anything and everything people use to upload their code in a file system as compared the file system of your computer. Foe every new project user starts a new repository which basically is a folder on the platform under his name and can decide to keep it private or public so that visitors/other users can also know what their friends and colleagues are upto only if a user allows this by keeping the code public. It's user friendly design helps to update or change code by using few simple steps. It's one of the most cllaborative software if you are working in a team.

        Now we know about GitHub but what is GitHub desktop then ? How are they different from each other? So as you know that GitHub is a web app but from the name only it's pretty clear that GitHub Desktop is software to be installed on your PC. GitHub Desktop is like an easy method of starting projects accessing them on your PC, pushing them on the Web App of GitHub even pulling down the data  which is the user might have changed on the web directly so that it stays safe even if your PC doesn't boot or you accidentally deleted your file or any other issue. Initially both the tools seems to be really difficult to use but once you get your hands dirty doing it, you will know how easy and useful it is. </p>
